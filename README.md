Generate Changelog from GitHub Releases
=======================================
[![CI][ci-badge]][ci]

`changelog-from-release` is a (too) small command line tool to generate changelog from
[GitHub Releases][gh-releases]. It fetches releases of the repository via GitHub API and generates
changelog in Markdown format.

For example, [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) was generated from [the releases page][releases].

Other real-world examples:

- https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md
- https://github.com/rhysd/hgrep/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md
- https://github.com/rhysd/git-brws/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md


## Installation

Download binary from [the releases page](https://github.com/rhysd/changelog-from-release/releases) or
build from sources with Go toolchain.

```
$ go install github.com/rhysd/changelog-from-release/v3@latest
```


## Usage

Running `changelog-from-release` with no argument outputs a changelog text in Markdown format to
stdout. Please redirect the output to your changelog file.

```
$ cd /path/to/repo
$ changelog-from-release > CHANGELOG.md
$ cat CHANGELOG.md
```

Automation with [GitHub Actions][gh-actions] is also offered. Please read
[action's README](./action/README.md) for more details.

```yaml
- uses: rhysd/changelog-from-release/action@v3
  with:
    file: CHANGELOG.md
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

For more usage, see `-help` output.


## Reference auto linking

References in a release note are automatically converted to links by `changelog-from-release`.

- **Issue references** like `#123` are converted to links to the issue pages
- **User references** like `@rhysd` are converted to links to the user profile pages
- **Commit references** like `93e1af6ec49d23397baba466fba1e89cc8b6de39` are converted to links to the
  commit pages. To avoid false-positives, only full-length (40 characters) commit hashes are converted.

For example,

```markdown
Commit: 93e1af6ec49d23397baba466fba1e89cc8b6de39
Author: @rhysd
Issue:  #123
```

is converted to

```markdown
Commit: [`93e1af6ec4`](https://github.com/owner/repo/commit/93e1af6ec49d23397baba466fba1e89cc8b6de39)
Author: [@rhysd](https://github.com/rhysd)
Issue:  [#123](https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/123)
```


## FAQ

### How to update changelog before adding the release tag?

For example, how to include changes for v1.2.3 in `CHANGELOG.md` before creating a Git tag `v1.2.3`?

Please use [a release draft][gh-draft].

1. Click 'Draft a new release' button in releases page and write up release note for the next release
2. Click 'Choose a tag' drop down and enter a tag name for the release which is not created yet. Then
   click '+ Create new tag: ... on publish' item in the drop down.
3. Save the draft by clicking 'Save draft'
4. Run `changelog-from-release` with setting [a personal access token][pat] to `$GITHUB_TOKEN`
   environment variable
5. Commit the generated changelog
6. Create and push the new Git tag. Ensure the tag name is the same as one entered at 2.
7. Go to the draft release page created at 1. and publish the release by clicking 'Publish release'
   button

Setting a personal access token at 2. is mandatory since release drafts are private information.
API token associated with your account is necessary to fetch it. If you use [the action](./action/README.md),
an API token is automatically generated by GitHub Actions so you don't need to create a token by
yourself.

### How to insert some templates at top/bottom of generated changelog?

Since `changelog-from-release` command just generates changelog history, you can insert your
favorite templates before/after redirecting the generated output to `CHANGELOG.md` file.

```sh
# Insert header
cat <<-EOS > CHANGELOG.md
Changelog
=========

This is a footer.

EOS

changelog-from-release -l 2 >> CHANGELOG.md

# Insert footer
cat <<-EOS >> CHANGELOG.md

This is a footer.
EOS
```

If your shell supports `$()`, header and footer can be inserted once.

```sh
cat <<-EOS > CHANGELOG.md
Changelog
=========

This is a header.

$(changelog-from-release -l 2)

This is a footer.
EOS
```

`-l 2` means using `##` instead of `#` for each release section. Please adjust it for your use case.

If you're using [the action](./action/README.md), use `header` and `footer` inputs to insert texts
before/after the generated changelog.

```yaml
- uses: rhysd/changelog-from-release/action@v3
  with:
    file: CHANGELOG.md
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    args: -l 2
    header: |
      Changelog
      =========

      This is header.
    footer: |-

      This is footer.
```

### How to ignore some release tags?

For example, if your project has `nightly` tag release for nightly builds, it should be excluded from
changelog.

In this case, use `-i` command line option to ignore some release tags by regular expression:

```sh
changelog-from-release -i '^nightly$' > CHANGELOG.md
```

### How to extract some release tags?

For example, if your project uses `v{major}.{minor}.{patch}` format for release tags, a changelog
should be created with extracting them.

In this case, use `-e` command line option to extract some release tags by regular expression:

```sh
changelog-from-release -e '^v\d+\.\d+\.\d+$' > CHANGELOG.md
```

### How to ignore draft releases?

If you're using the GitHub Action and don't want draft releases to be included in the changelog, you
can use the `-d` flag to omit them:

```yaml
- uses: rhysd/changelog-from-release/action@v3
  with:
    file: CHANGELOG.md
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    args: -d=false
```

## Environment variables

### `GITHUB_API_BASE_URL`

For [GitHub Enterprise][ghe], please set `GITHUB_API_BASE_URL` environment variable to configure API
base URL.

```sh
export GITHUB_API_BASE_URL=https://github.your-company.com/api/v3
```

### `GITHUB_TOKEN`

If `changelog-from-release` reported API rate limit exceeded or no permission to access the repository,
consider to specify [a personal access token][pat].

```sh
export GITHUB_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
